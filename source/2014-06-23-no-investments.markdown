You may have seen that Turing is organized as a non-profit, expecting approval
as a 501(c)(3) from the IRS within the next 10 months. I frequently then get the
question *"how's that working out for you?"* And the answer is *"it's difficult."*
The paperwork, the accountability, not qualifying for things like SBA loans, etc.
Yes, I'm familiar with "B Corps", but they're not the same.

A big part of the 501(c)(3) decision was about investment -- **I'm against it**. I
bootstrapped [Jumpstart Lab](http://jumpstartlab.com) in 2009, so doing the same
with Turing just made sense. But if you look around you'll find developer education
programs taking investment left and right, some in the tens of millions of dollars.

  > Are you against *investment* or are you against Venture backed education. I'd like to believe that if someone like the "gates foundation" or some reputable (by whatever handy yardstick) NFP wanted to help with funding that you'd consider it. Putting a stake in the ground is okay, putting one in your foot or your own fiscal heart is not.

That's a *big problem*. Investors don't give money away, *they expect it back*.
And in the tech world, they're looking for 10x return on investment. If they put
in 18 million dollars they're shooting for a payout of 180 million.

  > Careful with this argument. Your **students** are investors in your program. They expect a return on their investment. Indeed, the argument for public education goes back to one of basic economic returns. You should clarify **why** this is a big problem (for you) and what could make investment in this okay. I suspect that you're trying to get more to the point that traditional venture models **usuall** don't have ROI timelines that work with educational models. Perhaps you should suggest a **new** venture model for eductation.  Or outline what would have to change in traditional venture to make it okay to invest in bootcamps.  Perhaps you've been hanging around too many Ruby people but bitching without suggesting a solution (working on one even better) is at best churlish.

Where does all that money come from? **Students**. For every dollar an investor puts
in they want *ten student dollars back*. That tuition paid into the system, instead
of paying for their instructors and facilities, pays investors. That money is
sucked out of the ecosystem.

  > Careful here - this is a weak strawman argument. If I were a big VC I could easily say that I want the investment as my **real** business of tech startups can only be killed if there aren't enough asses in seats for me to offer shitty stock options to.  Also consider that there are *for profit* universities that do exactly this, do a good job of it, and return money to investors. Generally they serve a segment of the population that would __never__ get support from traditional educational institutions. (Think University of Phoenix and HEALD college.)

**What's right for investors is orthogonal to what's right for students**. If we claim
to be focused on the best possible outcomes for our students *and* take investment, then
then we're lying to one side or another. And the side with the smaller wallet is the
side that gets lied to.

  >  Weak argument. Qualify the argument here - I think your point is a good one: it's difficult to serve two masters. So the question is are the VCs investing in the Devschool or the Students. Is there a way to align these interests?

Is it hard to bootstrap while watching competitors take on huge investments? Of
course. But this is too important. I've made compromises on my beliefs in the past,
and I paid a huge price. It won't happen again. This is our chance to do it right.

And no outsider, regardless of how deep their pockets, will call the shots.

  > I'm all for putting a stake in the ground. I'm just not sure if this is the right stake at the right time. The post comes across as being inflamatory as opposed to being constructive.  But perhaps that's the tone you'd like to convey.
